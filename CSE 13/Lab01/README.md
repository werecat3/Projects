End of lab write up: In this lab, I did a couple different activities. I started out by doing the normal hello world to start practicing a new language. Then I went on to use a sorting code and mess around with it so that I could understand the programming enviroment we are using. Finally I was given a temperature converter to try and fix some issues by myself. I needed to figure out how to use the printf and I was able to. Through the lab, I had many mistakes with using the programming enviroment. I couldn't figure out for the longest time how to debug the part1 code if my part2 code was open. I also couldn't figure out the settings very well. But after awhile I was able to understand it all, and now I'm getting more comfortable with the programming. This lab was really nice and I really enjoyed it. The only thing that you may need to change is some of the phrasing because it seems to be outdated. For example, when you look at the history of the file changes, the lab says to click on show local history and diff to, but I don't have either of
those options. I just had local history. So maybe I'm dumb, or maybe I am just on a newer update, but ya.
