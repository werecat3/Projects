My partner was Xuxuan Liang.

I wrote Message.c, Negotiation.c, AgentTest.c, FieldTest.c.
Xuxuan wrote Agent.c, Field.c, MessageTest.c, NegotiationTest.c

The final push is in Xuxuan's repository.

The only person I collaborated with was Xuxuan. I asked ta's and the discord general questions but nothing too in depth.

From my understanding of the system, we have 4 files. Negotiation will determine who goes first. Message will take in the inputs from the user and use it to change the game. Field is what controls the boats and everything in the display. Finally agent is what makes the game actually run.

What worked well for me was negotiation, and some of message. Parcemessage was really bad for me because the autograder kept giving back runtime errors, but my computer wouldn't give me any.

From this lab I learned that working with a partner can make the work load and flow much easier. I also learned good communication skills.

I liked that it wasn't as hard as I was expecting it to be. The biggest thing that needs to change is that the .h and the lab doc don't explain the funstions well at all. It could be much better explained.
