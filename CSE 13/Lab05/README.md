Results for timing-
Selection sort: 47.312 ms
Insertion sort: 25.411 ms
From this we can tell that the insertion sort function sorts the list 23 milisecond faster that selection sort. This was expected because the insertion sort makes it so we don't sort to incorrect spots. The word will be put near its correct spot the first time instead of maybe being moved around a couple different times.


This lab was very interesting. This lab we spent a lot of time understanding memory and what we can do with it. By using malloc or calloc, we were able to make doubly linked lists and affect different stuff in diverse ways. I think these were the most important aspects of the lab. This lab doc, I think really covered what we had to do in the lab.

My approach to this lab was really long. I started by just understanding the logic by reading the lab doc over and over again. Then from there, I worked on how to manipulate the memory and how to impliment the logic. So I started coding each of the funtions in the function section. What went wrong through this lab is that I couldn't get the code quite right. I didn't understand the arrows or how to use them to my advantage. If I were to do it again, I would spend way more time trying to understand what the code actually does. I got help from other people by asking simple questions about how the logic works. It really really helped me and I could not have done this without the help of ta's or other students. 

The results of this turned out good. Once I started testing my test harness I found it really easy to understand what my stuff did. I then found almost all my attempts worked perfectly. This lab I spent probably 16 hours or so. I liked how well my test harness worked when I started testing things. I really disliked how alone we were with understanding how to implement the code. I really felt like I was expected to just know how the code worked. I think the best way to improve this lab is if you provided how to code way to access the memory. I didn't understand anything about the arrows to access memory and it was so hard to understand anything about how to program. I think overall the points distribution is good, but I don't think the doc helped enough. It should go way more in depth. The examples from section and the ta's literally saved me in the lab. Without it I would have never ever finished this lab. I think the actual class needs to spend much more time explaining code and not just what malloc does. It would really be helpful.
