The reason you can't let scanf(" "); execute is that it doesn't have a place to store the input from the user so therfore an error will occur.

The banning of printf() and scanf() in functions forced us to understand local and global variable. If we were able to use a print inside of a function then we could just do a variable in that and then print with it, and then we wouldn't need to look at a function for the outcome. 

This lab was very good for me. I just took cse 12 and I am taking CSE 30 at the same time as this class, so when I code I think in assembly too much. This lab helped me get used to c and get out of the thinking of assembly. It only took me about 8 hours to complete, but that was with me trying to forget assembly while learning C. I thought this lab was going to be hard, but once I got used to C, I was able to speed through it.

P.S - I have no clue how many commits I have but please can I have the 1 point if I have just 9. Thank you have a good day.
